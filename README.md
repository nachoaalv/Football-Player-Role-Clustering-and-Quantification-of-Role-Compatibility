# Football Player Role Clustering and Role Compatibility

This repository accompanies my dissertation. It includes Jupyter notebooks, processed data outputs, figures, and the final PDF.

## Data source
This project uses football event data from the StatsBomb Open Data repository:
- StatsBomb Open Data: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data
- License: https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/LICENSE.md

Raw data is not redistributed here; only processed files derived for academic purposes are included.

## Repository contents
- `notebooks/` — analysis notebooks (preprocessing, clustering, dimensionality reduction, synergy matrices, lineup optimizer, evaluation)
- `data/` — processed datasets only (no raw StatsBomb files), with a `README` describing transformations
- `results/` — figures and matrices
- `dissertation.pdf` — full dissertation

## Reproducibility
Environment and run instructions will be added after initial upload of notebooks and data outputs.
